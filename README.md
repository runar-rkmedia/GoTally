# GoTally

At the moment, this is another implementation of my older game Tally Board, which I released for iOS in 2014.

## About the game

The game is inspired by 2048, but the player sees more mathematically aligned challenges.

## About this project

This project now serves more as a playground for me testing some new technology.

I am planning to create a package here to perhaps test the usage of [Buf](https://buf.build/), just for kicks.
